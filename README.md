ALTHOUGHTHE BASIC FUNCTIONS HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED, THERE ARE STILL FEATURES THAT HAVE NOT BEEN FULLY  IMPLEMENTED SO SOME STUFF WON'T WORK. 

Installation
1. Download file
2. Unzip anywhere you want
3. Create a shortcut to desktop

Note: That you can use either the .exe to run or the ps1. 

Setup
Kommander is meant to be run from a central folder so that there is a single copy of it that is used for all mods. It creates a globalsettings.json in that folder.  It will create a Kommander folder within each mod that contains the mod specific settings.

The first time that you run Kommander it will pop up in the global settings form.  Kommander will attempt to locate the game folder, workbench folder, etc.  However, if it can't find it or if its wrong you need to choose the correct folder. The standard setup is for the game folder to be the server folder also as typically we use dayzdiag_64.exe for both server and game.  You must choose where to put your source code and packed mods.  You can put them where ever you want. Kommander will make the appropriate links if you run it as administrator.  If not, you must run the included linkall.bat file after you complete the first three steps in the process.
